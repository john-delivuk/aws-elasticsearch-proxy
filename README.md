# AWS Elasticsearch Service Proxy

Simple HTTP Proxy to resign your AWS Elasticsearch Service requests. This gives you flexibility to create an interal proxy for your users to view kibana, without having to white list addresses. This is a temp fix until AWS decides to add ENI support to the service, or internal VPC endpoint like S3.
